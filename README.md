# Library Trackr

**(Development Ongoing)**

Library Trackr is a NodeJS web app that aims to combine features of both Calibre Web and the iOS app, Book Track.

Library Trackr lets user's add their own books to their collection (using the Goodreads API), tag books with their location (i.e. iBooks, print, eBook or Kindle), open them in e-reader apps and upload public domain books so they can be downloaded anywhere. Books can be sorted by series, author and genre etc.
