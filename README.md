# Library Trackr

**(Development Ongoing)**

Library Trackr is a NodeJS web app that aims to combine features of both Calibre Web and the iOS app, Book Track.

## Aims

Library Trackr lets user's add their own books to their collection (using the Goodreads API), tag books with their location (i.e. iBooks, print, eBook or Kindle), open them in e-reader apps and upload public domain books so they can be downloaded anywhere. Books can be sorted by series, author and genre etc.
